# Approach
The mobile and desktop version of the Purchase list are significantky different in layout, responsive behavior and interaction (considering pagination for table and inifinity list for card view). Considering this I chose to go with the approach of having separate components for mobile vs desktop version. 

## 

# Enhancements
[] Pagination for Desktop view
[] Infinity list for Mobile view
[] Spinner/Skeleton component for loading state
[] Error screen for error state
[] Actions on purchase items
